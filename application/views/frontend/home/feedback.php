					<p>This was my fourth coach purchase, the first from a dealer, and far and away the best pre-purchase disclosures and delivery experience. The comprehensive video tour of rvmaxus made me comfortable wiring the entire purchase price to allow a Sunday delivery when a cashiers check could not be verified. 1500 mile trouble free trip home including heavy rain and light snow 5 Stars in my book and a new lifelong customer!! - Jim R in Colorado </p>

					We bought a 2004 Thor Mandalay from RVMAX in August of 2017 after an extensive nation-wide search for a motorhome that 					would fit our family.  The communication from Sachin was top-notch and when we arrived from Cincinnati, the coach was in 					the exact shape in which it was advertised.  He had done a video with every detail and it was so helpful as we were 					shopping.  On the day we went to Greenville, we were given attention the ENTIRE day to go over every aspect of the 					motorhome until we felt comfortable and were ready to drive back to Cincinnati.  We even enjoyed a little Mexican food.  					We had a terrific experience and we would recommend RVMAX to anyone in the market for a motorhome. - Hodges in Ohio
